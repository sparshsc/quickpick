# quickpick
QuickPick is a mobile iOS App designed to streamline student pickup at schools and enable instant and efficient communication between parents and school staff. It leverages the Camera QR support from iOS AVFoundation framework to scan a barcode in every car that comes up for pick up. Once scanned, the app would look up associated student’s information stored in its Firebase Realtime database and inform the school staff to bring the student out to the loading zone. Quickpick app downloaded on each staff member’s phone would log into the respective school’s account using Firebase Authentication, thereby ensuring the information is specific to the tenant, in this case the school. The app has a web interface that is displayed on monitors around the school so students and staff can monitor without needing a phone. This app taught me how to modularize into different components, understand the database concepts and using of RESTful services with proper tenant based authentication.
